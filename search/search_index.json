Proof : Let \ud835\udefc = a + bi, \ud835\udefd = c + di Then \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i \\\\ = (c+a) + (d+b)i \\\\ = (c + di) + (a + bi) \\\\ = \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udefc \\square 1A.2 Show that (\ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udefc + (\ud835\udefd + \ud835\udf06) for all \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd, \ud835\udf06 \u2208 \ud835\udc02 .

Proof : \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd) = (e+fi)((a+bi)+(c+di)) \\\\ = (e+fi)((a+c)+(b+d)i)\\\\ = ((a+c)e - (b+d)f) + ((a+c)f + (b+d)e)i \\\\ On the other hand \ud835\udf06\ud835\udefc + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udefd = (e+fi)(a+bi) + (e+fi)(c+di) \\\\ = (ea-bf) + (eb+fa)i + (ec-fd) + (ed+fc)i \\\\ = (ea + ec - bf - df) + (af + cf + be + de)i \\square 1A.5 Show that for every \ud835\udefc \u2208 \ud835\udc02 , there exists a unique \ud835\udefd \u2208 \ud835\udc02 such that \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd = 0 . Proof : If \ud835\udefc = a + bi , then let \ud835\udefd = (-a) + (-b)i , we can see \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd = 0 .

Proof : let r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt[]{3} i}{2} Then r^2 = \\frac{1}{4} ((1-3) + 2 \\sqrt[]{3}i) \\\\ = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt[]{3}i}{2} Then r^3 = \\frac{1 + 3}{4} = 1 \\square 1A.8 Find two distinct square roots of \ud835\udc56 . Solution : Let (a+bi)^2 = i , then a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = i So we can have r_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt[]{2} + \\sqrt[]{2}i}{2}, r_2 = \\frac{-\\sqrt[]{2} + -\\sqrt[]{2}i}{2}, \\square 1A.9 Find \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc11^4 such that (4, \u22123, 1, 7) + 2\ud835\udc65 = (5, 9, \u22126, 8).

Proof : (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f)\ud835\udc65 = (ab)(x_1, \\cdots, x_n) \\\\ =((ab)x_1, \\cdots, (ab)x_n) \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65) is the same. \\square 1A.13 Show that 1\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc05^\ud835\udc5b Proof : 1\ud835\udc65 = 1 (x_1, \\cdots, x_n) \\\\ = (1 \\cdot x_1, \\cdots, 1 \\cdot x_n) \\\\ = (x_1, \\cdots, x_n) = x \\square 1A.14 Show that \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc66 for all \ud835\udf06 \u2208 \ud835\udc05 and all \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66 \u2208 \ud835\udc05^\ud835\udc5b . Proof : \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udf06 ((x_1, \\cdots, x_n) + (y_1, \\cdots, y_n)) \\\\ = \ud835\udf06 (x_1+y_1, \\cdots, x_n+y_n) \\\\ = (\ud835\udf06(x_1+y_1), \\cdots, \ud835\udf06(x_n+y_n)) \\\\ = (\ud835\udf06 x_1 + \ud835\udf06 y_1, \\cdots , \ud835\udf06 x_n + \ud835\udf06 y_n) \\\\ = \ud835\udf06 (x_1, \\cdots, x_n) + \ud835\udf06 (y_1, \\cdots, y_n) \\\\ = \ud835\udf06 x + \ud835\udf06 y \\square 1A.15 Show that (\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f)\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65 for all \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f \u2208 \ud835\udc05 and all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc05^\ud835\udc5b Proof : \\begin{split} (\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f)\ud835\udc65 &= (a+b)(x_1, \\cdots, x_n) \\\\ &= ((a+b)x_1, \\cdots, (a+b)x_n) \\\\ &= (ax_1 + bx_1, \\cdots, ax_n + bx_n) \\\\ &= (ax_1, \\cdots, ax_n) + (bx_1, \\cdots, bx_n) \\\\ &= a (x_1, \\cdots, x_n) + b (x_1, \\cdots, x_n) \\\\ &= ax + bx \\end{split} \\square 1B Definition of Vector Space 1B.1 Prove that \u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 for every \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 . Proof : From 1.32 \u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc63) = (-1)(-v) \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\\\ \u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc63) + (\u2212\ud835\udc63) = (-1)(-v) + (1)(-v) = (-1 + 1)(-v) = 0(-v) = 0 On the other hand, v + (\u2212\ud835\udc63) = 0 . So both of them are the additive inverse of the (\u2212\ud835\udc63) . From 1.27 , they are the same. \\square 1B.2 Suppose \ud835\udc4e \u2208 \ud835\udc05, \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 , and \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63 = 0 . Prove that \ud835\udc4e = 0 or \ud835\udc63 = 0 . Proof : If a =0 , then it's valid. If a \\neq 0 , then a has a multiplicative inverse a^{-1} . a^{-1}(av) = (a^{-1}a)v = v . On the other hand, from 1.31, a^{-1}0 = 0 . So we have v = 0 . \\square 1B.3 Suppose \ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc64 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 . Explain why there exists a unique \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 such that \ud835\udc63 + 3\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc64 . Proof : We add v 's additive inverse on both side and get (-v) + (\ud835\udc63 + 3\ud835\udc65) = ((-v) + v) + 3x = 0 + 3x = 3x = w - v Then we multiply the multiplicative inverse of 3 , we got x = 3^{-1} (w-v) So x is unique and satisfy this equation. \\square 1B.4 The empty set is not a vector space. The empty set fails to satisfy only one of the requirements listed in the definition of a vector space (1.20). Which one? Solution : It must be \"additive identity\": There exists an element 0 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 such that \ud835\udc63 + 0 = \ud835\udc63 for all \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 . \\square 1B.5 Show that in the definition of a vector space (1.20), the additive inverse condition can be replaced with the condition that 0\ud835\udc63 = 0 \\text{ for all } \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49. Here the 0 on the left side is the number 0 , and the 0 on the right side is the additive identity of \ud835\udc49 . Proof : We just need to use this condition to prove the existence of additive inverse. Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 , and let w = (-1)v , then w + v = (-1)v + 1v = ((-1) + 1)v = 0v = 0 So w is the additive inverse of v . \\square 1B.6 With these operations of addition and scalar multiplication, is \ud835\udc11 \u222a {\u221e, \u2212\u221e} a vector space over \ud835\udc11 ? Explain. Solution : commutativity: yes. associativity: no. Let u = 1, v = \u221e, w = -\u221e \\\\ (u + v) + w = \u221e + (-\u221e) = 0 \\\\ u + (v+w) = 1 + (\u221e + (-\u221e)) = 1 + 0\\\\ So it's not a vector space over \\mathbb{R} . \\square 1B.7 Suppose \ud835\udc46 is a nonempty set. Let \ud835\udc49^\ud835\udc46 denote the set of functions from \ud835\udc46 to \ud835\udc49 . Define a natural addition and scalar multiplication on \ud835\udc49^\ud835\udc46 , and show that \ud835\udc49^\ud835\udc46 is a vector space with these definitions. Solution : Similar as 1.24, we define For \ud835\udc53, \ud835\udc54 \u2208 V^\ud835\udc46 , the sum \ud835\udc53 + \ud835\udc54 \u2208 V^\ud835\udc46 is the function defined by (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc46 . For \ud835\udf06 \u2208 \ud835\udc05 and \ud835\udc53 \u2208 V^\ud835\udc46 , the product \ud835\udf06 \ud835\udc53 \u2208 V^\ud835\udc46 is the function defined by (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc53)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf06 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc46 . commutativity : Proof : (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = g(x) + f(x) = (g+f)(x) \\square associativity : Proof : ((f+g)+h)(x) = (f+g)(x) + h(x) = (f(x) + g(x)) + h(x) \\\\ =f(x) + (g(x) + h(x)) = f(x) + (g+h)(x) \\\\ = (f + (g+h))(x) ((ab)f)(x) = (ab) f(x) = a (bf(x)) = a ((bf)(x)) = (a(bf))(x) \\square additive identity : Proof : Define 0(x) = 0, \\forall x \\in V . (f+0)(x) = f(x) + 0(x) = f(x) + 0 = f(x) \\square additive inverse : Proof : Define g(x) = -f(x) , then (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = f(x) + (-f(x)) = 0 multiplicative identity : Proof : (1 \\cdot f)(x) = 1 \\cdot f(x) = f(x) \\square distributive properties : (\ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc53+g))(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf06 ((\ud835\udc53+g)(x)) = \ud835\udf06 (f(x) + g(x)) \\\\ = \ud835\udf06f(x) + \ud835\udf06g(x) = (\ud835\udf06f)(x) + (\ud835\udf06g)(x) = (\ud835\udf06f + \ud835\udf06f)(x) ((\ud835\udf06 + \u03bc)f)(x) = (\ud835\udf06 + \u03bc) f(x) = \ud835\udf06f(x) + \u03bcf(x) \\\\ = (\ud835\udf06f)(x) + (\u03bcf)(x) = (\ud835\udf06f + \u03bcf)(x) \\square 1B.8 Suppose \ud835\udc49 is a real vector space. The complexification of \ud835\udc49 , denoted by \ud835\udc49^\ud835\udc02 , equals \ud835\udc49\u00d7\ud835\udc49 . An element of \ud835\udc49^\ud835\udc02 is an ordered pair (\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63) , where \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 \u2208 \ud835\udc49 , but we write this as \ud835\udc62 + \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63 .

Then V_1 + \\cdots + V_m is a direct sum if and only if the only way to write 0 as a sum \ud835\udc63_1 +\u22ef + \ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc5a , where each \ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc58 \u2208 \ud835\udc49_\ud835\udc58 , is by taking each \ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc58 equal to 0 . Proof : \\Rightarrow By definition, if V_1 + \\cdots + V_m is a direct sum, then 0 can be written in only one way, since 0 + \\cdots + 0 = 0 , then it is the only way. \\Leftarrow Assume v = v_1 + \\cdots + v_m \\\\ v = v_1' + \\cdots + v_m' \\\\ Then 0 = v - v = (v_1 - v_1') + \\cdots + (v_m - v_m') Then v_1 = v_1', \\cdots, v_m = v_m' So V_1 + \\cdots + V_m is a direct sum. \\square 1.46 direct sum of two subspaces Suppose \ud835\udc48 and \ud835\udc4a are subspaces of \ud835\udc49 . Then U+W \\text{ is a direct sum} \\Longleftrightarrow \ud835\udc48 \u2229 \ud835\udc4a = \\{0\\}. Proof : \\Rightarrow If U+W is a direct sum, and assume u \\in \ud835\udc48 \u2229 \ud835\udc4a , then -u \\in \ud835\udc48 \u2229 \ud835\udc4a . So u + (-u) = 0 Then u = 0 .

Then from 1.45, U+W is a direct sum. \\square Sums of subspaces are analogous to unions of subsets. Similarly, direct sums of subspaces are analogous to disjoint unions of subsets. No two sub- spaces of a vector space can be disjoint, because both contain 0. So disjoint- ness is replaced, at least in the case of two subspaces, with the requirement that the intersection equal {0}.","title":"Chapter 01 Notes"},{"location":"ch01notes/#chapter-1-vector-spaces","text":"","title":"Chapter 1 Vector Spaces"},{"location":"ch01notes/#1b-definition-of-vector-space","text":"","title":"1B Definition of Vector Space"},{"location":"ch01notes/#124-notation-fs","text":"If \ud835\udc46 is a set, then \ud835\udc05^\ud835\udc46 denotes the set of functions from \ud835\udc46 to \ud835\udc05 .

Then from 1.45, U+W is a direct sum. \\square Sums of subspaces are analogous to unions of subsets. Similarly, direct sums of subspaces are analogous to disjoint unions of subsets. No two sub- spaces of a vector space can be disjoint, because both contain 0. So disjoint- ness is replaced, at least in the case of two subspaces, with the requirement that the intersection equal {0}.","title":"1.46 direct sum of two subspaces"}]}
